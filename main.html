        <header id="head4"><b><u>Advantages of donating blood</u></b></header>
        <p>Prevents hemochromatosis</p>
        Donating blood would reduce the risk of developing hemochromatosis. This health condition could be inherited at
        our cost due to alcoholism, anaemia and various other disorders.
        <p>Blood cell production</p>
        After a person donates blood, the body will replenish the blood loss by stimulating the production of new blood
        cells. The new blood cells would help in maintaining a personâ€™s good health.
        <p>Lowering cancer risk</p>
        Donating blood helps lower the risk of cancer as the iron stores in the blood are maintained at healthy levels.
        When there is a reduced iron level in the body, it is linked to lower cancer risk. At the same time, when the
        iron is too low in the body, it leads to iron deficiency and other related health conditions.
        Heart and liver health
        Donating blood is beneficial as it reduces the risk of heart and liver ailments which are caused due to iron
        overload in the body. When people consume excess food in the body, they only absorb limited proportions, and the
        rest of it gets stored in the heart, liver, or pancreas.
        Excess iron present in the body will increase the risk of developing health conditions like liver failure,
        pancreatic damage, or heart abnormalities.
        Therefore, by donating blood, the body can maintain the required levels of iron and reduce the risk of various
        health conditions.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Donating blood</strong> is an excellent way to serve the community as both the donor and the receiver will reap health
        benefits.
        Blood donating processes are quick and easy.
        Usually, there are no side effects while donating blood. If a person is a frequent blood donor consulting a
        doctor about iron supplements and getting the blood level normal in the body is mandatory.

        <p id="def"><b>Giving the "right" type of blood donation</b> - based on your blood type and patient needs -
            helps ensure
            the

            the most impact.<br>The human body contains five liters of blood, which is made of several useful components
            i.e. <b>Whole blood, Power Red,

                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Whole blood is the most flexible type of donation. It can be
                    transfused in its original form, or
                    used to help multiple people when separated into its specific components of red cells, plasma and
                    platelets.<br>

                    <b>Who it helps:</b> Whole blood is frequently given to trauma patients and people undergoing
                    surgery.<br>

                    <b>Time it takes:</b> About 1 hour<br>

                    <b>Ideal blood types:</b> All blood types<br>

                    <b>Donation frequency:</b> Every 56 days, up to 6 times a year

                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During a Power Red donation, you give a concentrated dose of red
                    cells, the part of your blood used
                    every day for those needing transfusions as part of their care. This type of donation uses an
                    automated process that separates your red blood cells from the other blood components, and then
                    safely and comfortably returns your plasma and platelets to you.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith just a little extra time at your appointment, you can donate
                    more red cells and increase your
                    impact on patients in need.
                    Who it helps: Red cells from a Power Red donation are typically given to trauma patients, newborns
                    and emergency transfusions during birth, people with sickle cell anemia, and anyone suffering blood
                    loss.<br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that form clots and stop
                    bleeding. Platelets are most often
                    used by cancer patients and others facing life-threatening illnesses and injuries.<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In a platelet donation, an apheresis machine collects your
                    platelets along with some plasma,
                    returning your red cells and most of the plasma back to you. A single donation of platelets can
                    yield several transfusable units, whereas it takes about five whole blood donations to make up a
                    single transfusable unit of platelets.<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Platelets are collected at Red Cross donation centers only, and
                    are not collected at blood drives.<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who it helps: Platelets are a vital element of cancer treatments
                    and organ transplant procedures, as
                    well as other surgical procedures.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During an AB Elite donation, you give plasma, a part of your
                    blood used to treat patients in
                    emergency situations. AB plasma can be given to anyone regardless of their blood type. Plasma is
                    collected through an automated process that separates plasma from other blood components, then
                    safely and comfortably returns your red blood cells and platelets to you. AB Elite maximizes your
                    donation and takes just a few minutes longer than donating blood.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Plasma is collected at select Red Cross donation centers.
                    Who it helps: AB Plasma is used in emergency and trauma situations to help stop bleeding.<br>
